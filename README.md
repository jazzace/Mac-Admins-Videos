# Mac-Admins-Videos
A reference for common sources of conference, meetup, and instructional videos for Mac Admins.

The code part of the repo hosts a web page with links to _collections_ of videos useful to Mac Admins. These will often be an account on a video service account (e.g., YouTube) with playlists, but may also be self-hosted or hosted through an app. This is not exclusively for Conference or Meetup presentations, even though those form the bulk of the relevant content. How-to video accounts, vlogs, and even dedicated social media accounts would be reasonable additions.

## Individual videos
If you have favourite videos that you think should be shared more widely, add them to the Wiki by category. Just [follow the instructions for editing the Wiki](https://github.com/jazzace/Mac-Admins-Videos/wiki).
